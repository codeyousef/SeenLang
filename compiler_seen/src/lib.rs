// compiler_seen/src/lib.rs
// Main library file for the Seen compiler.

// This crate is responsible for the core compilation logic of the Seen language,
// including lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, IR generation, optimization,
// and code generation.

// Declare the Intermediate Representation (IR) module.
pub mod ir;

// Declare the Optimization passes module.
pub mod optimizations;

// Declare the analysis module.
pub mod analysis;

// --- Bilingual Note Placeholder ---
// The compiler's internal logic is implemented in Rust (and eventually Seen itself).
// It is designed to process Seen source code written in either English or Arabic.
// All language-specific elements are handled by the lexer and parser,
// ensuring that subsequent stages (like IR and optimizations) operate on a
// language-agnostic representation.

// TODO: Add main compiler logic, CLI interface, etc.

// Placeholder for a public function to demonstrate crate usage.
// This will be expanded as the compiler develops.
pub fn compile(source_code: &str, language: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
    // TODO: Integrate lexer, parser, IR generation, etc.
    println!("Compiler invoked for language: {}", language);
    println!("Source code:\n{}", source_code);
    // For now, just echo back a success message.
