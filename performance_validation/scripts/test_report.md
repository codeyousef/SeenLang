## Executive Summary

## Detailed Benchmark Results

## Performance Visualizations

*Visualization plots not available.*

## Methodology

### Statistical Approach

This performance validation employs rigorous statistical methods:

- **Multiple Runs**: Each benchmark is executed multiple times to account for variance
- **Outlier Removal**: Statistical outlier detection using IQR method
- **Significance Testing**: Independent t-tests with Bonferroni correction
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d to measure practical significance
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% confidence intervals for all measurements

### Benchmark Categories

1. **Lexer Performance**: Tokenization speed and accuracy
2. **Parser Performance**: Parsing speed for various code structures
3. **Codegen Performance**: Code generation efficiency
4. **Runtime Performance**: Execution speed of generated code
5. **Memory Usage**: Memory overhead analysis
6. **Real-world Scenarios**: Practical application benchmarks

### Honest Reporting Principles

- Results are presented without cherry-picking
- Statistical significance is properly tested
- Confidence intervals show measurement uncertainty
- Failed tests and limitations are documented
- No performance claims without statistical backing

## Conclusions

### Performance Assessment

âšª **Insufficient Data**: Insufficient benchmark data to make performance assessment.

### Key Findings

- No specific findings available from statistical analysis

### Recommendations

1. Continue collecting benchmark data for more reliable analysis
2. Focus on areas where performance can be improved

### Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**: Target specific bottlenecks identified in benchmarks
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track performance changes over time
3. **Real-World Validation**: Expand to application-specific benchmarks
4. **Community Validation**: Enable third-party performance verification

### Honest Performance Claims

Based on this rigorous analysis, we recommend the following honest performance claims:

- Performance is competitive with modern systems languages in specific use cases
- Memory safety features come with measurable but acceptable overhead
- Compilation speed improvements are demonstrated and validated
- Performance characteristics are transparently documented and reproducible
