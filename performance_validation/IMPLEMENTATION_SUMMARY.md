## 📈 Expected Realistic Results

Based on the comprehensive testing framework, expected realistic results include:

### Likely Performance Outcomes
- **Lexer**: 6-10M tokens/sec (competitive with C++, not 14M)
- **Memory**: 5-20% overhead (reasonable for safety features, not -58%)
- **Runtime**: 0.8x-1.5x C++ speed (competitive range)
- **Compilation**: Potentially faster than C++ (simpler language)
- **Reactive**: 10-30% overhead vs manual loops (not zero-cost but reasonable)

### Honest Assessment Framework
- ✅ **Claims validated**: Performance meets or exceeds stated claims
- ⚠️ **Claims partially met**: Performance close but not quite meeting claims  
- ❌ **Claims not met**: Performance significantly below claims with clear evidence
