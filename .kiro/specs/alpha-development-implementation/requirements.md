# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete implementation of the Seen Language Alpha Development Plan, transforming the current 5% complete bootstrap compiler into a fully functional language implementation. The feature encompasses implementing all phases of the Alpha Development Plan in sequential order, starting with Phase 1 (Core Language Foundation) and progressing through all 8 phases to achieve a production-ready, self-hosting compiler.

The implementation must follow the mandatory standards of 100% real implementation with zero hardcoded keywords, complete tooling ecosystem, and full adherence to the Syntax Design specification. This is a comprehensive transformation from a basic bootstrap compiler to a complete programming language implementation.
