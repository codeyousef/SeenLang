# Seen Language Product Overview

Seen (ุณ) is a revolutionary systems programming language designed to be the world's most performant programming language while maintaining developer happiness and inclusivity.

## Core Mission

Combine blazing performance with intuitive developer experience through:
- **10x faster compilation** than LLVM with E-graph optimization
- **20%+ faster executables** than GCC -O3 through ML-driven optimization
- **Zero-overhead memory management** with Vale-style safety
- **Universal deployment**: Native, WebAssembly, Mobile from single codebase

## Key Differentiators

### Performance Leadership
- Revolutionary optimization pipeline: E-graphs + Machine Learning + Superoptimization + PGO
- Self-hosting compiler (100% implemented in Seen)
- JIT execution under 50ms for instant feedback
- AOT compilation for production performance

### Developer Experience
- Zig-style C interop: Import C headers directly, no bindings needed
- Modern syntax inspired by Kotlin with functional programming features
- Comprehensive IDE support via Language Server Protocol
- Complete testing and benchmarking framework

### Universal & Inclusive
- **Multi-language support**: Write code in English, Arabic, Chinese, and more via TOML configuration
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux (x64, ARM64, RISC-V)
- **Zero mixing**: Each project uses ONE language consistently

## Current Status

**Alpha Phase Complete** - Fully functional self-hosting compiler with:
- Complete lexer, parser, type system, and code generation
- All 21 Kotlin-inspired language features implemented
- Full LSP server with IDE integration
- RISC-V architecture support
- Comprehensive test suite (100+ tests passing)
- Performance benchmarking framework

## Target Users

- Systems programmers seeking performance without sacrificing safety
- Developers wanting modern language features with zero-cost abstractions
- International developers who prefer coding in their native language
- Teams building high-performance applications across multiple platforms
