# Seen Language Project - Claude Code Context

**Version**: 0.05 | **Phase**: Bootstrap Development - 5% Complete | **Reality**: 36-48 weeks to production

## 🚨 CRITICAL HONESTY REQUIREMENT 🚨

**THIS PROJECT REQUIRES 100% REAL IMPLEMENTATION - NO LIES, NO STUBS, NO PRETENDING**

## Current Truth About This Project

### What We Actually Have (5%)
```seen
// This is ALL that works:
let x = 42
let y = x + 10  
if y > 50 { println("big") }
struct Point { x: Int, y: Int }  // But field access is hardcoded to index 0!
```

### What We Claimed But DON'T Have (95%)
```seen
// NONE of this works - all FALSE CLAIMS:
if age >= 18 and hasPermission { }  // ❌ 'and' keyword not implemented
let greeting = "Hello, {name}!"     // ❌ String interpolation missing
let user: User? = FindUser(id)      // ❌ Nullable types missing  
user?.name                          // ❌ Safe navigation missing
match value { 0 -> "zero" }         // ❌ Pattern matching missing
async fun FetchData() { }           // ❌ Async/await missing
let data = move originalData        // ❌ Memory management missing
fun (p: Person) Name(): String { }  // ❌ Method syntax missing
```

## Mandatory Implementation Standards

### RULE #1: 100% REAL IMPLEMENTATION
**EVERY feature must be COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL following `docs/Syntax Design.md`**
- ❌ NO stub functions
- ❌ NO TODO comments
- ❌ NO panic! placeholders
- ❌ NO "not yet implemented" errors
- ❌ NO hardcoded workarounds (like struct field index 0)
- ✅ ONLY complete, working, tested implementations

### RULE #2: DYNAMIC KEYWORD LOADING
**ALL keywords MUST be loaded from TOML files - ZERO hardcoding**

```rust
// ❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - NEVER DO THIS:
if token == "fun" { TokenType::Function }
if token == "if" { TokenType::If }

// ✅ REQUIRED - ALWAYS DO THIS:
let keywords = KeywordManager::load("en.toml")?;
if token == keywords.get("function") { TokenType::Function }
```

**Language Files Required:**
- `en.toml` - English keywords
- `ar.toml` - Arabic keywords
- `es.toml` - Spanish keywords
- `zh.toml` - Chinese keywords
- `fr.toml` - French keywords
- (minimum 10 languages)

### RULE #3: FULLY FUNCTIONAL TOOLING
**Every tool must be PRODUCTION-READY and updated with each feature**

#### LSP Server Requirements
```rust
// ALL of these MUST work - not just return empty results:
- Auto-completion (with TOML keywords)
- Hover information
- Go to definition  
- Find references
- Rename refactoring
- Real-time diagnostics
- Code formatting
```

#### VS Code Extension Requirements
```json
// ALL features MUST be implemented:
- Syntax highlighting (ALL constructs)
- IntelliSense (powered by LSP)
- Error diagnostics
- Code navigation
- Debugging support
- Keyword language switching
```

#### Installer Requirements
```rust
// MUST support ALL platforms:
- Windows (x64, ARM64)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)  
- Linux (x64, ARM64)
- Automatic updates
- Complete environment setup
```

## Critical Missing Implementations

### Language Features (From Syntax Design)

## Development Workflow - Real Implementation Only

### Before Writing Code:
```bash
# 1. Write tests FIRST
seen test --write tests/feature_x.seen

# 2. Verify no hardcoded keywords
grep -r '"fun"' src/  # Must return NOTHING
grep -r '"if"' src/   # Must return NOTHING

# 3. Load keywords properly
let keywords = load_toml("en.toml")
```

### During Development:
```bash
# No placeholders allowed
grep -r "todo!" src/        # Must be 0
grep -r "unimplemented!" src/ # Must be 0
grep -r "panic!" src/       # Only for real errors

# Test continuously
seen test --watch
```

### After Implementation:
```bash
# Update all tools
seen lsp --rebuild
seen vscode --package
seen installer --update

# Verify everything works
seen test --all
seen bench --performance
seen verify --syntax-design
```

## Timeline Reality Check

### Current Status: 5% Complete

**What "5% Complete" Really Means:**
- Can compile toy programs only
- Missing 95% of language specification
- Cannot compile real applications
- Cannot compile itself (self-hosting impossible)
- Tooling barely functional

### Realistic Timeline: 36-48 Weeks

| Milestone | Weeks | Deliverable |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Core Language | 6-8 | Lexer, Parser with ALL syntax |
| Type System | 4-6 | Nullable, Generics, Inference |
| Memory | 8-10 | Vale-style, Zero overhead |
| OOP | 6-8 | Methods, Interfaces, Extensions |
| Concurrency | 6-8 | Async/await, Channels, Actors |
| Reactive | 4-6 | Observables, Properties |
| Advanced | 8-10 | Effects, Contracts, Meta |
| **TOTAL** | **36-48** | **Production-Ready Compiler** |

## Essential Commands - When They'll Actually Work

### Currently Working (5%):
```bash
cargo build              # Builds bootstrap compiler
cargo test              # Tests basic features only
```

### NOT Working Yet (95%):
```bash
seen build              # ❌ Can't compile real Seen code
seen test              # ❌ Can't run Seen tests  
seen run              # ❌ Can't execute Seen programs
seen lsp              # ❌ LSP not fully functional
seen install          # ❌ Nothing complete to install
```

## Accountability Measures

### Daily Checks:
```bash
# Count forbidden patterns
seen audit --todos      # Must be 0
seen audit --hardcoded  # Must be 0  
seen audit --stubs      # Must be 0
```

### Weekly Validation:
```bash
# Verify against Syntax Design
seen validate --syntax-design docs/Syntax Design.md
# Compare implementation completeness
seen progress --honest
```

### Monthly Review:
- Line-by-line comparison with Syntax Design
- Test self-hosting capability
- Cross-platform testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Tool functionality audit

## Developer Agreement

**By working on this project, I commit to:**

1. **NEVER** claim a feature is complete without 100% implementation
2. **NEVER** use hardcoded keywords - always load from TOML
3. **NEVER** leave TODO/stub/placeholder code
4. **NEVER** claim false performance without benchmarks
5. **NEVER** say "self-hosting" until compiler can compile itself
6. **ALWAYS** implement complete Syntax Design specification
7. **ALWAYS** update LSP, VS Code extension, and installer
8. **ALWAYS** write tests before implementation
9. **ALWAYS** be honest about actual progress (currently 5%)
10. **ALWAYS** provide realistic timelines (36-48 weeks remaining)

## Current Project Phase

### Bootstrap Development - 5% Complete

**What This Means:**
- Using Rust to build initial compiler
- Can only compile trivial Seen programs
- Missing vast majority of language features
- Not ready for real use
- Cannot self-host

**Next Critical Steps:**
1. Implement dynamic keyword loading from TOML
2. Complete lexer with ALL token types
3. Complete parser with ALL syntax constructs
4. Build nullable type system
5. Implement Vale-style memory management

**Path to Self-Hosting:**
- Complete ALL missing features (95% of specification)
- Verify compiler can parse its own source
- Ensure all language constructs work
- Build complete optimization pipeline
- Only then attempt self-compilation

## The Bottom Line

**CURRENT REALITY:**
- **Version**: 0.05 (not 2.1)
- **Completion**: 5% (not "MVP ready")
- **Timeline**: 36-48 weeks needed (not "3 months to self-hosting")
- **Features**: Basic expressions only (not "revolutionary language")
- **Performance**: No optimization (not "faster than C/Rust")
- **Memory**: No management system (not "Vale-style safety")
- **Tooling**: Barely functional (not "production-ready")

**COMMITMENT REQUIRED:**
- 100% real implementation of Syntax Design
- Zero hardcoded keywords (all from TOML)
- Complete, functional tooling ecosystem
- No shortcuts, stubs, or false claims
- Realistic timeline and honest progress

**This is a research project requiring massive implementation effort, not a near-complete language.**
