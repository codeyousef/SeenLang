#### **Story 99: Future Vision Implementation**
**As the** Seen ecosystem  
**I want** to pioneer next-generation computing  
**So that** I shape the future of technology

**Expected Outcome:**
```seen
// Quantum-classical hybrid:
@quantum_accelerated
fun solveOptimization(problem: QUBO): Solution {
    // Classical preprocessing
    let reduced = classicalReduce(problem)
    
    // Quantum annealing
    let quantum = QuantumAnneal(reduced, shots = 1000)
    
    // Classical postprocessing
    return classicalRefine(quantum)
}

// Neuromorphic computing:
@neuromorphic
class SpikingNetwork {
    neurons: 1_000_000 LIF neurons
    synapses: Plastic, sparse
    learning: STDP
    power: <1 watt
}

// Extreme scale:
@exascale
fun climateSimulation(): Prediction {
    nodes = 100_000
    cores = 10_000_000
    performance = 1.exaflops
    efficiency = 20.gigaflops/watt
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Quantum interface working
- [ ] Neuromorphic backend supported
- [ ] Million-core scaling demonstrated
- [ ] Photonic computing feasible
