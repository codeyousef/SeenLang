## Critical Path to Self-Hosting

### Phase 1: Complete LSP Implementation (Step 12) **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
1. Implement core LSP protocol
2. Add all navigation features
3. Complete diagnostics engine
4. Build refactoring support
5. Add Kotlin feature support
6. Integrate reactive programming features
7. Add multilingual support
8. Performance optimization
9. Testing with major IDEs (VSCode, IntelliJ, Neovim)

### Phase 2: Self-Hosting (Step 13) **FINAL**
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
1. Port lexer to Seen (using LSP for development)
2. Port parser to Seen
3. Port type system to Seen
4. Port code generator to Seen
5. Port LSP server to Seen
6. Port reactive runtime to Seen
7. Bootstrap verification
8. Performance validation

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** LSP implementation is now the highest priority blocker for self-hosting. Without a complete LSP, developing the compiler in Seen would be extremely difficult and unproductive.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **LSP complexity** | **HIGH** - Blocks self-hosting | Start with core features, iterate |
| **LSP performance** | **HIGH** - Poor dev experience | Incremental parsing, caching |
| LSP memory usage | MEDIUM - IDE integration issues | LRU caches, pooling |
| Bootstrap complexity | MEDIUM - May take longer | LSP enables easier development |

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Begin LSP implementation (Step 12)
  - Week 1: Core protocol and navigation
  - Week 2: Diagnostics and refactoring
  - Week 3: Performance and IDE testing
2. **WEEK 4-6:** Self-hosting attempt (Step 13)
3. **WEEK 7:** Bootstrap verification and optimization

**MAJOR MILESTONE:** With LSP implementation, self-hosting becomes practical and productive, enabling all future development in Seen itself.
