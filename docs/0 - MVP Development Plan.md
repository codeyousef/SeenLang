1. Implement regex engine (basic subset)
2. Add TOML/JSON parsing
3. Create pretty printing utilities
4. Build diagnostic formatting
5. Add graph algorithms
6. Implement basic test framework

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Steps 10-11)
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks
1. Document formatting system
2. Extension functions
3. Data classes
4. Pattern matching
5. Smart casts
6. Coroutines
7. Other Kotlin features

### Phase 3: Self-Hosting (Step 12)
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
1. Port lexer to Seen
2. Port parser to Seen
3. Port type system to Seen
4. Port code generator to Seen
5. Bootstrap verification
6. Performance validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Missing compiler libraries | **HIGH** - Blocks self-hosting | Implement Step 8 immediately |
| No test framework | **HIGH** - Cannot verify correctness | Implement Step 9 next |
| Paradigm complexity | **MEDIUM** - May delay | Start with basic features |
| Self-hosting bugs | **MEDIUM** - May need fixes | Extensive testing during port |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| 8 blocking components | **HIGH** - 3-4 week delay | Focus only on critical path |
| Feature creep | **MEDIUM** - Scope expansion | Defer non-critical to Alpha |
| Bootstrap complexity | **MEDIUM** - May take longer | Start porting early components |

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Start Step 8 - Implement critical compiler libraries
2. **WEEK 1:** Complete regex engine and TOML/JSON parsers
3. **WEEK 2:** Add pretty printing and diagnostic formatting
4. **WEEK 3:** Implement graph algorithms and test framework basics
5. **WEEK 4:** Begin multi-paradigm features (Step 11)
6. **WEEK 5-6:** Complete remaining features and start self-hosting port
7. **WEEK 7-8:** Complete self-hosting and verify bootstrap

Without completing Steps 8-11, self-hosting is **impossible**. These are not optional enhancements but **critical requirements**.
