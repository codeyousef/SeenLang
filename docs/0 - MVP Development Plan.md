## Critical Path to Self-Hosting

### Phase 1: Unblock Self-Hosting (Steps 8-9)
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
1. **Implement TOML parser** (CRITICAL - needed for language system)
2. Build perfect hash table generator for keywords
3. Create binary caching system for language definitions
4. Implement auto-translation system
5. Add JSON parsing
6. Create pretty printing utilities
7. Build diagnostic formatting (multilingual)
8. Add graph algorithms
9. Implement basic test framework

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Steps 10-11)
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks
1. Document formatting system
2. Extension functions
3. Data classes
4. Pattern matching
5. Smart casts
6. Coroutines
7. Other Kotlin features

### Phase 3: Self-Hosting (Step 12)
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
1. Port lexer to Seen
2. Port parser to Seen
3. Port type system to Seen
4. Port code generator to Seen
5. Bootstrap verification
6. Performance validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| TOML parsing performance | **HIGH** - Could slow compilation | Perfect hashing + binary caching |
| Missing language system | **HIGH** - Blocks multilingual support | Implement TOML parser first in Step 8 |
| No test framework | **HIGH** - Cannot verify correctness | Implement Step 9 immediately after |
| Translation accuracy | **MEDIUM** - Could lose semantics | Extensive testing, AST-level translation |
| Language cache invalidation | **LOW** - Stale caches | Version checking, rebuild command |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| TOML parser complexity | **HIGH** - Could take longer | Use existing Rust TOML parser initially |
| Perfect hash generation | **MEDIUM** - Algorithm complexity | Use proven algorithms (CHD, FCH) |
| Auto-translation system | **MEDIUM** - Complex AST mapping | Start with subset of features |
| Bootstrap complexity | **MEDIUM** - May take longer | Start porting early components |

### Performance Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| TOML parsing overhead | **LOW** - Only at first build | Binary caching eliminates repeated parsing |
| Keyword lookup speed | **LOW** - Critical path | Perfect hash tables ensure O(1) |
| Translation speed | **LOW** - Development tool | Only used during migration |

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Start Step 8 - Implement TOML parser for language system
2. **WEEK 1:** Complete TOML parser, perfect hash generator, binary caching
3. **WEEK 2:** Add auto-translation system, JSON parser, pretty printing
4. **WEEK 3:** Implement diagnostic formatting, graph algorithms, test framework basics
5. **WEEK 4:** Begin multi-paradigm features (Step 11)
6. **WEEK 5-6:** Complete remaining features and start self-hosting port
7. **WEEK 7-8:** Complete self-hosting and verify bootstrap

Without completing Steps 8-11, self-hosting is **impossible**. The TOML-based language system is the **foundation** for multilingual support.
