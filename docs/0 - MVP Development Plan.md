- [ ] Build time: <10s for 100K line projects (beats Rust) ⏳ (Need full pipeline)
- [ ] Runtime performance: beats C/Rust/Zig on all benchmarks ⏳ (Need runtime)
- [ ] Self-compilation: <30s full bootstrap ⏳ (Need self-hosting)

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Self-hosting compiler compiles itself
- [ ] All cargo-equivalent commands implemented
- [ ] C interop works without manual bindings
- [ ] Multilingual syntax support functional
- [ ] Test framework catches all error types
- [ ] Debug information complete and accurate
- [ ] All features needed for future development in Seen

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] 100% test coverage for all core components
- [ ] All benchmarks passing with required performance
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in compiler and generated code
- [ ] Complete error handling with helpful messages
- [ ] Documentation coverage >90%
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with regression testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **LLVM Integration Complexity**: Start with simple IR generation, expand gradually
- **C Interop Edge Cases**: Focus on common use cases first, expand coverage
- **Memory Model Complexity**: Implement subset first, validate with extensive testing
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking with automatic alerts
- **Self-Hosting Gaps**: Identify all needed features early, implement incrementally

### Schedule Risks

- **Self-hosting Timeline**: Parallel development of Rust and Seen versions
- **Feature Creep**: Strict MVP scope, defer advanced features to Alpha
- **Integration Issues**: Early integration testing, weekly builds
