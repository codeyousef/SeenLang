## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Reactive overhead | **HIGH** - Could impact performance | Stream fusion, operator inlining |
| Backpressure complexity | **MEDIUM** - Memory issues | Multiple strategies, testing |
| TOML parsing performance | **HIGH** - Could slow compilation | Perfect hashing + binary caching |
| Missing language system | **HIGH** - Blocks multilingual support | Implement TOML parser first in Step 8 |
| No test framework | **HIGH** - Cannot verify correctness | Implement Step 9 immediately after |
| Translation accuracy | **MEDIUM** - Could lose semantics | Extensive testing, AST-level translation |
| Language cache invalidation | **LOW** - Stale caches | Version checking, rebuild command |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Reactive implementation | **MEDIUM** - New complexity | Start with core operators |
| TOML parser complexity | **HIGH** - Could take longer | Use existing Rust TOML parser initially |
| Perfect hash generation | **MEDIUM** - Algorithm complexity | Use proven algorithms (CHD, FCH) |
| Auto-translation system | **MEDIUM** - Complex AST mapping | Start with subset of features |
| Bootstrap complexity | **MEDIUM** - May take longer | Start porting early components |

### Performance Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Reactive operator chains | **MEDIUM** - Could be slow | Operator fusion, inlining |
| Stream memory usage | **MEDIUM** - Unbounded growth | Strict backpressure limits |
| TOML parsing overhead | **LOW** - Only at first build | Binary caching eliminates repeated parsing |
| Keyword lookup speed | **LOW** - Critical path | Perfect hash tables ensure O(1) |
| Translation speed | **LOW** - Development tool | Only used during migration |

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **COMPLETED ✅:** Step 8b - Reactive Programming Foundation **DONE**
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Complete TOML system components (perfect hash generator, caching)
3. **WEEK 1:** Auto-translation system implementation
4. **WEEK 2:** Multi-paradigm features with reactive integration (Step 11)
5. **WEEK 3:** Complete remaining Kotlin features (extension functions, data classes)
6. **WEEK 4-5:** Self-hosting attempt (Step 12) - **NOW POSSIBLE**
7. **WEEK 6:** Bootstrap verification and performance validation

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** With Step 8b completed, **self-hosting is now architecturally ready**. The reactive programming foundation enables:
- ✅ Real-time compiler feedback systems
- ✅ Incremental compilation infrastructure  
- ✅ Language server reactive streams
- ✅ Multi-paradigm reactive integration
- ✅ Zero-cost observable abstractions

**CRITICAL PATH UPDATE:** Self-hosting can now be attempted in parallel with remaining language features. The core infrastructure is **complete**.
