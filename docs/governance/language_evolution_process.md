# Seen Language Evolution Process

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial Draft)

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the process by which the Seen programming language will evolve. A formal process ensures that changes to the language are well-considered, discussed transparently, and implemented consistently, aligning with the language's goals of safety, performance, bilingualism, and developer experience.

Seen will adopt a **Seen Enhancement Proposal (SEP)** process for managing significant changes to the language, its standard library, and potentially core tooling or compiler features that have broad impact.

## 2. Goals of the SEP Process

*   **Transparency:** Provide a clear, public process for proposing and discussing language changes.
*   **Collaboration:** Encourage community involvement in the evolution of Seen.
*   **Quality:** Ensure that proposed changes are well-motivated, thoroughly designed, and consider alternatives and potential impacts.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain the coherence and design principles of the Seen language.
*   **Record Keeping:** Create a historical record of language design decisions and their rationale.

## 3. What Constitutes an SEP?

An SEP is required for changes such as:

*   **New Language Features:** Adding new syntax, keywords, or fundamental capabilities (e.g., a new concurrency primitive, changes to the type system).
*   **Significant Changes to Existing Features:** Altering the semantics or syntax of existing features in a non-trivial or non-backward-compatible way.
*   **Standard Library Additions/Changes:** Introducing new core modules or significantly altering existing APIs in the standard library.
*   **Compiler/Toolchain Features with Language Implications:** For instance, a new build system feature that requires changes to `seen.toml` in a way that affects all projects.
*   **Process Changes:** Modifications to the SEP process itself or other governance documents.

Minor bug fixes, performance improvements that don't alter language semantics, or documentation updates generally do not require an SEP, though they should follow standard contribution guidelines (e.g., issues and pull requests).

## 4. SEP Workflow

The SEP process will involve several stages:

1.  **Idea / Pre-Proposal (Discussion Phase):**
    *   An idea for a language change is typically first discussed informally on designated community platforms (e.g., Seen development forum, mailing list, or chat channel).
    *   The goal is to gauge initial interest, gather feedback, and refine the idea before committing to writing a full SEP.
    *   A core team member or an SEP Editor might guide this initial discussion.

2.  **Drafting the SEP (Authoring Phase):**
    *   If the idea gains traction, one or more authors draft an SEP using a standard template (see Section 6).
    *   The draft SEP should be submitted as a pull request to a designated repository (e.g., `seen-lang/seps`).
    *   An SEP Editor assigns an SEP number upon merging the initial draft.

3.  **Review and Discussion (Public Comment Phase):**
    *   Once the draft SEP is merged, it enters a public review period.
    *   Community members and the Seen core team review the SEP, providing feedback, raising concerns, and suggesting improvements via comments on the pull request or a dedicated discussion thread linked from the SEP.
    *   The SEP author(s) are expected to engage with feedback and revise the SEP as needed.
    *   This phase may involve iterative revisions and further discussions.

4.  **Decision (Core Team Approval):**
    *   After a sufficient period of discussion and revision, the Seen Core Team (or a designated Language Design Subcommittee) makes a decision on the SEP.
    *   Possible decisions:
        *   **Accept:** The SEP is approved for implementation. It may be accepted with minor conditions or revisions.
        *   **Reject:** The SEP is declined. Reasons for rejection should be clearly communicated.
        *   **Defer:** The SEP is put on hold, perhaps because it's a good idea but not a priority, or requires further foundational work.
        *   **Withdrawn:** The SEP author(s) may choose to withdraw their proposal.
    *   The decision and its rationale are recorded in the SEP itself.

5.  **Implementation:**
    *   Accepted SEPs are assigned to contributors (or a team) for implementation in the Seen compiler, standard library, or tooling.
    *   Implementation progress may be tracked via issues linked from the SEP.

6.  **Final / Active (Post-Implementation):**
    *   Once the implementation is complete, tested, and merged into a release, the SEP's status is updated to `Final` (for language features) or `Active` (for process SEPs).

## 5. SEP Editors and Core Team

*   **SEP Editors:** A small group responsible for managing the administrative and editorial aspects of the SEP process (assigning numbers, ensuring SEPs meet formatting guidelines, managing status updates). SEP Editors do not make decisions on accepting/rejecting SEPs but facilitate the process.
*   **Seen Core Team / Language Design Subcommittee:** A designated group of core contributors responsible for the overall technical direction of Seen. This team makes the final decisions on SEPs.
    *   The composition and selection process for the Core Team will be defined in a separate governance document.

## 6. SEP Template

SEPs should follow a standard template to ensure clarity and consistency. Key sections include:

*   **SEP Number:** (Assigned by an Editor)
*   **Title:** A concise title describing the proposal.
*   **Author(s):** Name(s) and contact information of the SEP author(s).
*   **Status:** (Draft, Review, Accepted, Rejected, Deferred, Withdrawn, Final, Active)
*   **Type:** (Feature, Standard Library, Tooling, Process)
*   **Created Date:** Date the SEP was first drafted.
*   **Last Updated Date:** Date of the last significant modification.
*   **Abstract:** A short (1-2 paragraph) summary of the proposal.
*   **Motivation:** Why is this change needed? What problems does it solve? What are the use cases?
*   **Detailed Design:** The core of the proposal. This section should describe the new feature or change in detail, including syntax, semantics, APIs, and examples (in both English and Arabic Seen where applicable).
*   **Rationale and Alternatives:** Why is this design the best approach? What other designs were considered, and why were they rejected?
*   **Impact Analysis:**
    *   **Backward Compatibility:** How does this change affect existing Seen code? Are there breaking changes?
    *   **Impact on Other Features:** How does this proposal interact with other language features or parts of the ecosystem?
    *   **Implementation Complexity:** How complex will this be to implement in the compiler, standard library, or tools?
    *   **Performance Impact:** Are there any potential performance implications (positive or negative)?
*   **Teaching and Usability:** How will this feature be taught to users? How does it affect the overall usability and complexity of the language?
*   **Unresolved Questions:** Any open issues or aspects of the design that still need to be figured out.
*   **Prior Art (Optional):** How do other languages handle similar features or problems?
*   **Discussion Link(s):** Link to the public discussion thread(s).
*   **Resolution:** (If Accepted/Rejected/Deferred) Summary of the decision and rationale.

## 7. Process Evolution

This SEP process itself is subject to evolution. Changes to the process will be managed via an SEP of type "Process".

## 8. Conclusion

The Seen Enhancement Proposal process aims to provide a structured yet collaborative framework for the evolution of the Seen language. It balances the need for careful design and community input with clear decision-making to ensure Seen remains a robust, coherent, and evolving language.
