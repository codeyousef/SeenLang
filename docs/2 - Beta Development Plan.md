## Risk Mitigation

### Language Risks

- **Translation Accuracy**: Extensive testing, semantic preservation
- **Performance Variance**: Continuous benchmarking per language
- **RTL/LTR Complexity**: Dedicated formatting engine
- **Cultural Differences**: Regional reviewers and validators

### Production Risks

- **Global Deployment**: Regional infrastructure planning
- **Language Updates**: Versioned language definitions
- **Cross-team Communication**: Translation validation tools

## Next Phase Preview

**Release Phase** will deliver:
- Support for 20+ human languages
- Global enterprise adoption framework
- Academic studies on multilingual programming
- International standardization efforts
- Cultural preservation through native-language coding
