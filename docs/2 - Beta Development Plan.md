**So that** I don't need external packages for basic vector math

**Current Reality:**
- No built-in SIMD support
- Math operations not vectorized
- Platform-specific code required

**Expected Outcome:**
```seen
// This code MUST compile and run efficiently on ALL architectures:
import std.simd.*

fun ProcessAudio(samples: Array<Float>): Array<Float> {
    // Automatic vectorization across platforms
    let vlen = Platform.vectorLength  // 16 for AVX-512, variable for SVE
    
    return samples.Chunks(vlen)
        .Map { chunk ->
            let vec = Vec4f.Load(chunk)
            let filtered = vec.Fma(0.5, 0.5)  // Fused multiply-add
            filtered.Store()
        }
        .Flatten()
}

// Must generate optimal code for each architecture:
// x86: AVX-512 instructions

// WASM: SIMD128 instructions
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**I want** built-in error handling and logging with zero overhead  
**So that** I can build reliable services without external dependencies

**Expected Outcome:**
```seen
// This MUST work in production with millisecond-critical performance:
import std.error.*
import std.log.*

// Compile-time filtered logging (zero overhead when disabled)
const MIN_LOG_LEVEL = Level.INFO  // DEBUG/TRACE compiled out

@service
fun HandleRequest(req: Request): Result<Response, Error> {
    log.Info("Processing request", fields = {"id": req.id})
    
    // Error handling with context
    let data = database.Query(req.query)
        .Context("Failed to query database")?
    
    // Async logging that doesn't block
    log.debug("Query returned {data.rows} rows")  // Compiled out in production (private)
    
    return Ok(Response(data))
}

// Must support structured logging to any backend

**Expected Outcome:**
```seen
// Must handle 1M concurrent connections:
import std.async.*

@main
async fun Main() {
    let server = TcpListener.Bind("0.0.0.0:8080")
    
    // Handle millions of concurrent connections
    while true {
        let (stream, addr) = await server.Accept()
        
        // Coroutine with <1KB stack usage
        spawn {
            handleConnection(stream)
        }
    }
}

async fun handleConnection(stream: TcpStream) {
    let request = await stream.ReadRequest()
    
    // Concurrent I/O operations
    let (userData, productData) = parallel(
        database.GetUser(request.userId),
        database.GetProduct(request.productId)
    )
