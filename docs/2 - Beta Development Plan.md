## 📋 MILESTONE 1: LLM INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK (Months 1-3)

### Epic: Optional Local LLM Assistance

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**: All LLM integration features will be implemented in **Seen itself** using the self-hosted compiler, demonstrating the language's capabilities for complex systems programming.

#### **Story 1: LLM Infrastructure & FFI Integration**
**As a** developer
**I want** a foundation for local LLM assistance
**So that** I can get intelligent help while maintaining privacy

**Expected Outcome:**
```seen
// seen.toml configuration
[llm]
enabled = false  // Opt-in only
model = "phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"
maxTokens = 1000
temperature = 0.3
inferenceThreads = 4
```

**Implementation Requirements (in Seen):**
- [ ] **LLM Engine Integration:**
    - [ ] `llama.cpp` C++ engine integration via Seen's C FFI
    - [ ] Seen bindings for llama.cpp with memory safety
    - [ ] Model loading and initialization system in Seen

    - [ ] Model validation and integrity checks
    - [ ] Support for multiple model sizes (0.5B to 7B parameters)
    - [ ] Quantization level selection (Q4_K_M, Q8_0, F16)
    - [ ] Model caching with Seen's memory management
    - [ ] Fallback mechanisms for model failures

- [ ] **Configuration System:**
    - [ ] LLM settings in `seen.toml` parser
    - [ ] Runtime configuration via CLI flags
    - [ ] Per-project LLM preferences
    - [ ] User preference persistence
    - [ ] Performance tuning options

- **Privacy:** 100% local execution, no network calls

#### **Story 2: Compiler Error Explanation (Phase 1)**
**As a** developer learning Seen
**I want** natural language explanations of compiler errors
**So that** I can understand and fix issues quickly

**Expected Outcome:**
```bash
# Terminal output with LLM assistance
$ seen build

error[E0001]: Use after move
  --> src/main.seen:15:5
   |
15 |     println(data.name)
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
12 |     let other = data
   |                 ---- value moved here

🤖 LLM Explanation:
This error occurs because 'data' was moved to 'other' on line 12, 
making it unavailable for use on line 15. In Seen's memory model, 
values can only have one owner at a time. 

To fix this, you can:
1. Clone the data: `let other = data.clone()`
2. Use a borrow: `let other = &data`
3. Use the data before moving it

Would you like me to show the corrected code?
```

**Implementation Requirements (in Seen):**
- [ ] **Error Context Collection:**
    - [ ] Structured diagnostic information from compiler
    - [ ] Source code context around errors
    - [ ] Type information and inference results
    - [ ] Memory ownership analysis results
    - [ ] Error classification and severity levels

- [ ] **LLM Prompt Engineering:**

    - [ ] Code example generation for fixes

#### **Story 3: Interactive Documentation Query (Phase 2)**
**As a** developer
**I want** to ask natural language questions about Seen
**So that** I can learn the language interactively

**Expected Outcome:**
```bash
# LSP hover or dedicated query
Developer: "How do I create a thread-safe counter in Seen?"

🤖 LLM Response:
In Seen, you can create a thread-safe counter using atomic operations:

```seen
import std.sync.Atomic

struct ThreadSafeCounter {
    value: Atomic<Int>
}

fun ThreadSafeCounter.new(): ThreadSafeCounter {
    return ThreadSafeCounter { value: Atomic<Int>.new(0) }
}

fun (counter: inout ThreadSafeCounter) increment(): Int {
    return counter.value.fetchAdd(1)
}

fun (counter: ThreadSafeCounter) get(): Int {
    return counter.value.load()
}
```

This uses Seen's built-in atomic types which provide lock-free operations
for better performance than mutex-based solutions.
```

    id: Int
    name: String
    email: String
}

suspend fun fetchUserData(userId: Int): Result<User, HttpError> {
    let client = HttpClient.new()
    let url = "https://api.example.com/users/${userId}"
    
    let response = await client.get(url)
    if (response.isError()) {
        return Err(response.error)

**Expected Outcome:**
```toml
# seen.toml
[package]
name = "my-app"
version = "1.0.0"

[dependencies]
seen-web = "1.0"
seen-sql = { version = "2.0", features = ["postgres"] }
seen-ml = { git = "https://github.com/org/seen-ml" }
seen-llm = { version = "1.0", optional = true }  # LLM assistance package

[dev-dependencies]
seen-test = "1.0"

[build-dependencies]
seen-build = "1.0"
```

```bash
$ seen package add seen-gpu
✓ Resolving dependencies
✓ Downloading seen-gpu v1.0.0
