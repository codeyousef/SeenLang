# [[Seen]] Language Alpha Phase Development Plan

## Overview: Advanced Features & Developer Experience

**Duration**: Months 3-6  
**Prerequisites**: Completed MVP with self-hosting compiler and multi-paradigm support  
**Goal**: Production-ready language with advanced tooling and optimization  
**Development Language**: **SEEN** (All development from this point forward in Seen, not Rust)

**Core Alpha Requirements:**

- Advanced optimization pipeline (E-graph, MLIR) leveraging paradigm features
- Complete standard library with advanced functional/OO patterns
- LSP server with paradigm-aware completions
- Package manager with trait/typeclass resolution
- Advanced C++ interoperability including templates
- WebAssembly with functional programming optimizations
- Production debugging for all paradigms

**CRITICAL**: All Alpha phase development must be conducted in Seen language itself, using the self-hosted compiler from MVP. The language now supports functional, object-oriented, and concurrent paradigms, which should be leveraged throughout Alpha development.
