# [[Seen]] Language Alpha Phase Development Plan

## Overview: Advanced Features & Developer Experience

**Duration**: Months 3-6  
**Prerequisites**: Completed MVP with self-hosting compiler, complete LSP, and multi-paradigm support (including reactive)  
**Goal**: Production-ready language with advanced tooling, optimization, and reactive programming excellence  
**Development Language**: **SEEN** (All development from this point forward in Seen, not Rust)

**Core Alpha Requirements:**

- Advanced optimization pipeline (E-graph, MLIR) leveraging all paradigms including reactive
- Complete standard library with functional/OO/reactive patterns
- Package manager with trait/typeclass/reactive operator resolution
- Advanced C interoperability including reactive bindings
- WebAssembly with reactive and functional programming optimizations
- Production debugging for all paradigms including reactive flows

**CRITICAL**: All Alpha phase development must be conducted in Seen language itself, using the self-hosted compiler and complete LSP from MVP. The language now supports functional, object-oriented, concurrent, and reactive paradigms, which should be leveraged throughout Alpha development.
