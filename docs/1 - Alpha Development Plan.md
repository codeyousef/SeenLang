# [[Seen]] Language Alpha Phase Development Plan

## Overview: Advanced Features & Developer Experience

**Duration**: Months 3-6  
**Prerequisites**: Completed MVP with self-hosting compiler and multi-paradigm support (including reactive)  
**Goal**: Production-ready language with advanced tooling, optimization, and reactive programming excellence  
**Development Language**: **SEEN** (All development from this point forward in Seen, not Rust)

**Core Alpha Requirements:**

- Advanced optimization pipeline (E-graph, MLIR) leveraging all paradigms including reactive
- Complete standard library with functional/OO/reactive patterns
- LSP server with paradigm-aware completions including reactive streams
- Package manager with trait/typeclass/reactive operator resolution
- Advanced C++ interoperability including reactive bindings
- WebAssembly with reactive and functional programming optimizations
- Production debugging for all paradigms including reactive flows

**CRITICAL**: All Alpha phase development must be conducted in Seen language itself, using the self-hosted compiler from MVP. The language now supports functional, object-oriented, concurrent, and reactive paradigms, which should be leveraged throughout Alpha development.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Language Loading Performance**: Perfect hashing and binary caching
- **Translation Accuracy**: Extensive testing, semantic validation
- **WebAssembly Language Support**: Embed language at compile time
- **C Header Translation**: Focus on common patterns first
- **Reactive Operator Overhead**: Aggressive fusion and inlining
- **Stream Memory Management**: Strict lifecycle management
- **Backpressure Complexity**: Multiple strategies, extensive testing

### Integration Risks

- **IDE Language Support**: Test with multiple languages continuously
- **Package Registry**: Support language metadata from start
- **Cross-platform**: Ensure RTL/LTR works on all platforms
- **Reactive Debugging**: Build visualization tools early
- **Stream Type Inference**: Leverage existing type system

## Next Phase Preview

**Beta Phase** will focus on:
- Production deployment for global teams with reactive applications
- Showcase applications in multiple languages using reactive patterns
- Performance validation across all languages and paradigms
- Community building in multiple regions
- Security hardening for multilingual and reactive systems
- Documentation in 10+ languages covering all paradigms
