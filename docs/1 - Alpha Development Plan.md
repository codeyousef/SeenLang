// STATUS: No self-hosting compiler written in Seen yet
// REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION:
// - Complete Seen compiler written in Seen language
// - Bootstrap from current Rust implementation
// - Prove language completeness and usability
// - Performance within 2x of Rust bootstrap compiler
// PREREQUISITE: All lexer issues resolved ‚úÖ
```

### Quick Status Check Commands:
```bash
# Verify NO hardcoded keywords (should return nothing):
grep -r '"fun"\|"if"\|"while"\|"let"\|"for"' seen_lexer/src/ seen_parser/src/  ‚úÖ VERIFIED

# Run tests (49+ tests, 100% should pass):
cargo test -p seen_lexer      # ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSING
cargo test -p seen_parser     # Parser tests (will fail - no implementation)

# Build check:
cargo build --workspace       # ‚úÖ BUILDS CLEAN

# Check for TODOs/stubs (should be zero):
grep -r "todo!\|unimplemented!" seen_lexer/src/ seen_parser/src/ | wc -l  ‚úÖ ZERO IN LEXER
```

```rust
// ‚ùå NEVER: Fake test passing
#[test]
fn test_string_interpolation() {
    println!("Hello, Alice!");  // Just printing expected output
    assert!(true);  // Not actually testing the feature
}

// ‚ùå NEVER: Hardcoded behavior
if token == "fun" {  // Must use keyword manager
    return TokenType::Function;
}

// ‚ùå NEVER: Stub implementations
fn compile_async(&self, node: &AsyncNode) -> IR {
    todo!("Implement async compilation")  // Not acceptable
}

// ‚ùå NEVER: Lying about capabilities
fn supports_feature(&self, feature: &str) -> bool {
    true  // When it's not actually implemented
}
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS METRICS

**The Alpha is ONLY complete when:**

1. **Can compile and run the Seen compiler itself** (self-hosting)
2. **Can build real applications** (web servers, CLI tools, games)
3. **All syntax from Syntax Design.md works** (100% coverage)
4. **Zero hardcoded keywords** (all from TOML)
5. **Zero stub implementations** (everything real)
6. **Performance meets targets** (within 2x of C++)
7. **Tool ecosystem complete** (LSP, VS Code, installer)
8. **10+ example applications** (proving practicality)
9. **Community can contribute** (in any human language)
10. **No "not yet implemented" errors** (ever)

---

## üìù WEEKLY ACCOUNTABILITY

**Every Friday, verify:**
- [x] Run hardcoded keyword detector: `grep -r '"fun"\|"if"\|"while"' src/` ‚úÖ ZERO results
- [x] Count TODOs: `grep -r "todo!\|unimplemented!\|panic!" src/ | wc -l` ‚úÖ ZERO in production
- [ ] Run test suite: `cargo test` (100% must pass)
- [ ] Check coverage: `cargo tarpaulin` (>90% required)
- [ ] Benchmark performance: `cargo bench` (no regressions)
- [ ] Compile test program: `seen examples/hello.seen` (must execute)

**Remember: This is building a REAL programming language, not a demo or prototype.**

## üéØ Example of Proper Seen Syntax

When implementing, remember these core syntax rules:

```seen
// 1. Capitalization = Visibility
fun ProcessData(input: String): String {    // Public (capital P)
    return process(input)                   // Private function call
}

// 2. Word-based logical operators
if age >= 18 and hasPermission {           // NOT: &&
    // authorized
} else if not verified or expired {        // NOT: ! ||
    // denied
}

// 3. String interpolation uses {}
let message = "Hello, {name}!"             // NOT: ${name}
let info = "Age: {user.Age}"               // NOT: $user.age

// 4. Everything is an expression
let status = if active { "on" } else { "off" }
let result = match value {
    0 -> "zero"
    1..10 -> "small"
    _ -> "large"
}

// 5. Async/await syntax
async fun FetchData(): Data {
    let response = await Http.Get(url)
    return response.Data
}
```
