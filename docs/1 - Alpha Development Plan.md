# [[Seen]] Language Alpha Phase Development Plan

## Overview: Advanced Features & Developer Experience

**Duration**: Months 3-6 **Prerequisites**: Completed MVP with self-hosting compiler **Goal**: Production-ready language with advanced tooling and optimization **Development Language**: **SEEN** (All development from this point forward in Seen, not Rust)

**Core Alpha Requirements:**

- Advanced optimization pipeline (E-graph, MLIR)
- Complete standard library with networking
- LSP server for IDE integration
- Package manager and registry
- Advanced C++ interoperability
- WebAssembly first-class support
- Production debugging and profiling tools

**CRITICAL**: All Alpha phase development must be conducted in Seen language itself, using the self-hosted compiler from MVP. The Rust bootstrap implementation is archived and only used for emergency recovery.
