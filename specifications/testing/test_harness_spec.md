# Seen Language Test Harness Specification

## Overview
This document specifies the test harness architecture for the Seen programming language compiler and toolchain. The test harness follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where tests are written before implementation.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Location**: `src/tests/` or `src/<module>/tests.rs` within each crate
- **Scope**: Individual functions, methods, and small modules
- **Framework**: Rust's built-in `#[test]` with additional utilities

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Location**: `tests/` directory in each crate
- **Scope**: Inter-module interactions within a crate
- **Framework**: Rust's integration test framework

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/` in workspace root
- **Scope**: Full compilation pipeline from source to executable
- **Framework**: Custom harness built on top of Rust tests

## Test Infrastructure Components

### Test Utilities Library
- Generate test source files
- Create temporary project structures
- Custom assertions for compiler-specific checks
- Test data builders using the builder pattern

### Error Testing Framework
- Structured error expectations
- Bilingual error message testing

### Language-Specific Testing
- Test both English and Arabic variants
- Parameterized tests for language features

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
- Unit tests in `src/tests/`
- Integration tests in `tests/`
- E2E tests in workspace `tests/e2e/`
- Benchmarks in `benches/`

### Test Naming Conventions
- Test functions: `test_<component>_<scenario>_<expected_result>`
- Test modules: `<feature>_test.rs`
- Fixtures: `fixtures/<category>/<name>.<ext>`

## Continuous Integration

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum line coverage: 90%
- Minimum branch coverage: 80%
- Critical paths: 100%

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No test flakiness allowed
- Coverage must not decrease
- Benchmarks must not regress more than 5%
