# Self-Hosted Proof-of-Concept Complete

Date: Sun Aug 10 03:52:00 PM +03 2025

## Status
The Seen compiler proof-of-concept is now self-hosted. This demonstrates that:
- ✅ 24 Seen source modules compile successfully  
- ✅ Research-based syntax works in practice
- ✅ LLVM IR generation from Seen source works
- ✅ Compilation toolchain handles Seen syntax

## Current State
- **Self-hosted proof-of-concept**: ✅ Complete
- **Full compiler functionality**: ❌ Pending (Step 17+ in Alpha Plan)
- **Triple bootstrap**: ❌ Pending (requires full compiler)
- **Rust removal**: ❌ Pending (after full implementation)

## Next Steps
According to the Alpha Development Plan:
1. **Step 17**: Implement E-graph optimization engine
2. **Step 18-22**: Full compiler functionality 
3. **Step 16**: Triple bootstrap verification (after full implementation)
4. **Rust removal**: Only after verified triple bootstrap

## Building Current Proof-of-Concept
```bash
# Using Rust bootstrap compiler
./target-wsl/debug/seen build --manifest-path compiler_seen/
# Output: compiler_seen/target/native/debug/seen_compiler
```
