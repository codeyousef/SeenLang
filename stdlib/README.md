# Seen Standard Library (`stdlib`)

This directory contains the source code for the Seen Standard Library.

The standard library provides core types, functions, and modules for common programming tasks in Seen.

## Modules

*   `core/`: Fundamental types (integers, floats, `Option`, `Result`), traits, and essential functions.
*   `io/`: Input/output operations (files, console).
*   `collections/`: Common data structures (vectors, hash maps).
*   ... (other modules will be added here)

## Development

The standard library is written in Seen and is compiled alongside the Seen compiler.

For more information on the design and philosophy, refer to the learning modules in `docs/learning_modules/stdlib/`.
